# CPU Scheduling in OS Simulator

## Programming Language: Python (Tkinter)

## Description of the Project:
- This project is to simulate how our OS uses CPU to schedule the tasks based on different algorithms: Shortest-Job First, Shortest Remaining Time, Priority, and Round Robin Algorithm.
- Calculation result of the turnaround time, waiting time will be calculated and a gantt chart will be drawn to show the clear picture of each CPU Scheduling algorithm

## Instructions:
- Make sure that python is installed in your device.
- After installing/cloning the repo, open "Command Prompt" and change your directory to the folder you installed/cloned the repo at.
- After changing the directory, type "python main.py" to run the app.
- When the app is successfully opened, type the number of processes and click on "Submit" button.
- The info (burst time, arrival time, and priority) for each process will be required for inputs, after the input you could proceed to click on "Submit Process Info" button.
- The process information will be shown in the main page and you could proceed to click on "Run Algorithm" button to see the outcome of each algorithm.
- You will be able to see the process info, calculation result of turnaround and waiting time, and a gantt chart of showing the result of the algorithm produced for CPU Scheduling.
